## Notes to demonstrators

Our role here is to empower the students so they:
   * feel confident messing around in the commandline
   * can be confident that what they did is correct.

So we do not just want to give them answers. When you're talking to a student, *force* them to think. For example, if they ask a question, answer with a simpler question that helps to decompose the problem. Iterate as necessary.And/or check their skills - have they completely understood how to do the simple stuff? Encourage them to try things that will fail. Encourage them to decipher R's cryptic error messages - there is actually real information in them. Have *them* type; not you.

When we are in the room we should be constantly talking to students. Don't wait for questions - many students are too shy/embarrassed to ask them and will be grateful if you come up to them.

If you see a student doing things badly (e.g. copying R-code from Word; not using the built-in R text editor; not indenting thigns; not using human-friendly variable names), make it clear that there are better ways that will make it easier for you & them to write/read/understand/learn/be productive.

Work through the relevant material in preparation for a team meeting 1 week before the practical. Please edit the document to improve it! If you'd like to discuss a point or give a suggestion, you can email the group. The meeting will be an additional opportunity to clarify if/what needs to be revised/improved, or what the different possible approaches are for a given exercise (and their advantages/disadvantages).

### Additionally:
* ensure that you know how to do this stuff.
* undergraduates should have done http://tryr.codeschool.com/ before the first practical - you should be on top of all basic R handling too.
* The practicals are not necessarily easy/intuitive.
  * you should have worked through your practical at least 1 week beforehand. Where you struggled is likely where students will also struggle.
  * you guys can help each other out
* We are using the [Hadley Wickham style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
* For many exercises there are multiple possible solutions. That's cool. Some may be easier, some may suck.
* You are welcome (but by no means obliged!) to attend the lectures where we'll be going over the basics.
* The practicals as we have them are imperfect. Don't hesitate to suggest changes.
* In "light orange" are commenting links - you can make comments there; or liaise directly with the practical leader with regards to specific suggestions. These can include structure, wording, deleting/adding sections.

  # You will have to store the game results to a variable called game_result

  # If the user wins, write "You win." to game_result          # game_result <- "You win."
  # If the user loses, write "You lose." to game_result.       # game_result <- "You lose."
  # If there is a draw, write "Draw." to game_result.          # game_result <- "Draw."

  # Remember, rock wins against scissors, scissors win against paper, and paper wins against rock.
  # For example, if the user plays rock,
    # she/he wins if the computer plays scissors,
    # she/he loses if the computer plays paper
    # she/he draws if the computer plays rock

  # HINT: This may require many "if/else" statements

  # Return the game_result
  phrase_to_return <- paste("You played ", user_play, "; the computer played ", computer_play, ". ", game_result, sep='')
  return(phrase_to_return)
